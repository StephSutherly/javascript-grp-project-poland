      <li>Accommodation – Twelve-bed hostel dorms can be found
        for as little as 25 PLN per night, while 4-6 bed dorms
        will cost closer to 45 PLN. Private rooms generally
        cost 100-150 PLN, although this price varies by city.
        Free wifi is pretty much standard, though only a few
        hostels include free breakfast. Most hostels will have a
        kitchen so you can cook your own food. For those
        traveling with a tent, there are plenty of campgrounds
        all around the country. You can expect to pay 25-60 PLN
        per night for a basic plot. Budget hotels range
        from 110-250 PLN for a room with either single or
        double occupancy. Airbnb is an option in the larger
        cities (though selection is usually limited).
        For shared accommodation, you can expect prices to
        average around 95 PLN per night. An entire apartment
        will cost around 150 PLN per night.</li>
        <li>Food – While almost everything in Poland is
          incredibly affordable, eat with the locals at a milk
          bar (bar mleczny) for the best value. These restaurants
          were popular during communism as an affordable way to
          push nutrition on residents. They serve up cheap
          traditional fare in a cafeteria style atmosphere for
          around 25 PLN per meal. In my opinion, they are the
          best place to get a good meal in the country! If you’re
          looking for fast food, pizza calzones or burgers,
          expect to pay under 20 PLN. A more mid-range meal in
          a sit-down restaurant with table service will cost
          about 60 PLN for a meal with a drink. For a week’s
          worth of groceries, expect to pay 80-100 PLN for basic
          food stuffs (i.e. chicken, pasta, rice, veggies, bread,
          etc).</li>
