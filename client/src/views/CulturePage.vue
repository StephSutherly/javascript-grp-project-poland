    With a rich history that can be traced back over hundreds
    of years, Poland has a unique and diverse culture. As a
    country the minority populations are concentrated around
    the borders with the German minority mainly residing near
    the city of Opole in the southwest. In Warsaw and other
    major cities there has been a recent increase in the inward
    migration of other nationalities.

    When it comes to local culture, religion plays a vital
    role in society and an even bigger part in Polish culture.
    It is common for most businesses to close on religious holidays – they are considered to be national holidays in Poland.

    Christmas is considered the religious holiday that holds the
    most importance, with celebrations lasting a full 2 1/2 days.

    November 1st, All Saints Day is another very important
    religious holiday on the Polish calendar. It is a time to
    honour loved ones who are no longer with them, with many
    Poles visiting cemeteries.

    Baptisms, weddings, first communions, confirmations, and
    funerals are all very much influenced by religion;
    Poland is one of the most devoutly religious countries in Europe.</p>
